I'm currently a PhD student in the [Baby Speech Lab](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/bsl/angebote-fuer-zu-hause/babylab-app/) at the University of Konstanz, Germany. The DFG fundedproject I'm working on focuses on the influence of regional variants on phonological word representation in toddlers.

In my dissertation, I investigate the mental representations of varietal word forms in toddlers growing up in different dialect-standard situations, with data sampled from Germany and Switzerland(supervised by [Prof. Dr. Bettina Braun](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/braun-zinn/prof-dr-bettina-braun/) and [Prof. Dr. Tamara Rathcke](https://tamara-rathcke.github.io/)).
